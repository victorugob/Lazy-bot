# Lazy bot for SN Dev Instances 

Simple bot to quickly login on your DEV Instance.

The purpose behind it is for those who has one or more DEV instances on SN and forget to login, so the instance will hibernate.

## Requisites:
You need to have nodeJS installed on your machine, if you don't, follow the steps on the [following](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

This bot was developed using Pupeteer, check it out [here](https://pptr.dev/)

## Usage
After downloading, open the folder and check your laze.js file, theres a code comment right aside.

## Other

This a very basic piece of code and I intend to add more features like loggin in multiple instances and set it up to always run in a certain amount of time (if it's always running on the background or in a server).
